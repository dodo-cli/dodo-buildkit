# dodo buildkit plugin

Adds support for buildkit as a dodo builder plugin.

In the current version, it will ony detect the default builder that comes with the
docker daemon, similar to the docker cli.

## installation

This plugin is already included in the dodo default distribution.

If you compile your own dodo distribution, you can add this plugin with the
following generate config:

```yaml
plugins:
  - import: github.com/wabenet/dodo-buildkit
```

Alternatively, you can install it as a standalone plugin by downloading the
correct file for your system from the [releases page](https://github.com/wabenet/dodo-buildkit/releases),
then copy it into the dodo plugin directory (`${HOME}/.dodo/plugins`).

## configuration

The plugin will recognize `DOCKER_HOST` and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment
variables, as well as registry authentication configuration in `~/.docker`,
similar to the normal [docker cli](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).
